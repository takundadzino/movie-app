# movie-app

This is a React App that is accessing movies from an API using node js as the backend. Api Data is outputted as a carousel on the front-end showing the movies. Due to the nature of the API's some movies posters are no longer available. By accessing the API from the backend this allows for the API token to not be exposed to the public. Due to still needing to upskill iin backend work, I haven't used the api to access individual movie data and then sort the outputted movies by price.
